# Project: Learner Knowledge Base

Read the [project brief](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qLNzn9C5Higb7BYrpVl0Ucwl5SZCYCkyi0ReaE7_R6A).

## Project Expectations

- Use Jira for your project management and GitHub for your repo.
- Create a web application using ReactJS, NodeJS, Express, PostgreSQL.
- This application should allow learners to ask questions and have those questions answered by other learners or instructors.
- Instructors should have the ability to mark one of the answers as correct, so future visitors know what worked.
- It is expected that as a group you will validate your mock ups with real people from outside your group, before you invest too much time in coding. You will need to be able to provide proof of this validation and the responses received.
- Configure your database to work with the application using migrations.
- Configure your local environment, a CI/CD pipeline with Github Actions and a deployment process with Render.
